href="kernel.core.movic.html">kernel.core.movic</a> to detect conflicts between competing operations.</p>
<p>The default conflict relation of the MOVIC algorithm is not suitable for feature modeling as it does not consider the particular structure and rules for consistent feature models. Instead, we introduce two new conflict relations: <a href="kernel.core.conflict-relation.html#var-CO-conflicting.3F">CO-conflicting?</a> and <a href="kernel.core.conflict-relation.html#var-conflicting.3F">conflicting?</a>.</p>
<p>CO-conflicting? checks whether two compound operations are conflicting, provided that all operations leading up to (causally preceding) these operations did not trigger a conflict. Primitive operations in a compound operation are then subsequently applied to the feature model and a number of consistency properties are checked. If all pass, the operations are considered compatible, else a conflict is declared.</p>
<p>conflicting? ensures the precondition of CO-conflicting? that causally preceding operations have to be compatible and provides a feature model for applying primitive operation.</p>
<p>The conflict detection results are stored in a conflict cache to improve performance (because conflicting? is implemented recursively).</p></div></div><div class="public anchor" id="var-cached-conflicting*.3F"><h3>cached-conflicting*?</h3><div class="usage"><code>(cached-conflicting*?

<p>Some rules access to the feature model (e.g., children implicitly targeted by an operation), which has to be obtained by actually applying the operations to intermediate feature models. This is potentially slow, although this is only required if operations are eligible for conflict, i.e. concurrent, which is not the most common case.</p>
<p>Multiple rules are checked to guarantee basic feature model consistency (called syntactic consistency):</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <em>no-overwrites rule</em> flags two updates that target the same feature/constraint attribute as conflict.</li>
  <li>The <em>no-cycles rule</em> flags any two updates as conflict that introduce a cycle to the feature tree.</li>
  <li>The <em>no-graveyarded rule</em> flags an update and a remove (which is in turn a special update)  as conflict when the update targets the removed feature/constraint or an implicit child of the removed feature.  A special case must be considered, namely un-removing a removed or created feature/constraint  (setting the parent from :graveyard to something else).</li>
  <li>The <em>group-children rule</em> flags two updates as conflict if one changes a feature group to :or or  :alternative, and the other sets a child of said feature to mandatory or optional.</li>
  <li>The <em>assert-no-child-added rule</em> flags two updates as conflict if one asserts that no feature  children may be added by the other, but the other adds feature children nonetheless  (see <a href="kernel.core.compound-operation.html#var-remove-feature">kernel.core.compound-operation/remove-feature</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>All rules included here are checked in a short-circuiting way, so they may build upon each other, and they should return true if a conflict is present. These rules assume that CO-y has been applied and everything up to, but excluding PO-x.</p></div></div><div class="src-link"><a href="https://github.com/ekuiter/variED/blob/f91255d5f389ba8762a8746e260ff024e201ff3c/kernel/src/kernel/core/conflict_relation.cljc#L31">view source</a></div></div><div class="public anchor" id="var-CO-conflicting.3F"><h3>CO-conflicting?</h3><div class="usage"><code>(CO-conflicting?

<p>For that, produces a feature model suitable for subsequently applying CO-x. The feature models are well-defined, because the CDAG has all information regarding CP-x and CP-y across all sites (due to causality preservation), and we may simply assume base-FM to represent the CDAG garbage collected up to this point (so the base-FM can be seen as an implementation detail of the CDAG, i.e., if there was no base-FM, we would just use the entire CDAG on an empty initial feature model, which is clearly correct).</p>
<p>First applies <code>(set/intersection CP-x CP-y)</code> to <code>base-FM</code>, then <code>(set/difference CP-y (set/intersection CP-x CP-y))</code>. Because the intermediate result is not needed, their union can directly be applied, which is CP-y, yielding <code>base-FM+preceding-CO-y</code>.</p>
<p>Next, CO-y is applied, yielding <code>base-FM+preceding-CO-y+CO-y</code>. Both of these are required to ensure CO-conflict-reducer’s assert-no-child-added rule.</p>
<p>Next, <code>(set/difference CP-x (set/intersection CP-x CP-y))</code> is applied, which simplifies to <code>(set/difference CP-x CP-y)</code>, yielding <code>base-FM+preceding-CO-y+CO-y+preceding-CO-x</code>.</p>
<p>This feature model is fed into CO-conflict-reducer which subsequently applies all primitive operations contained in CO-x to produce a final <code>base-FM+preceding-CO-y+CO-y+preceding-CO-x+CO-x</code>.</p></div></div><div class="src-link"><a href="https://github.com/ekuiter/variED/blob/f91255d5f389ba8762a8746e260ff024e201ff3c/kernel/src/kernel/core/conflict_relation.cljc#L111">view source</a></div></div><div class="public anchor" id="var-compatible.3F"><h3>compatible?</h3><div class="usage"></div><div class="doc"><div class="markdown"><p>Determines whether two operations are compatible with each other.
